Reddit Robin Autogrow
=====================

This is a chrome browser extension to automatically click the "Grow" button on Reddit's 2016 April fools day chat experiment dubbed "Robin" (https://www.reddit.com/robin).

All the logic happens in `symbiote.js`, so if you're worried about privacy or security, feel free to browse the source.
